# 1704. 判断字符串的两半是否相似 Determine if String Halves Are Alike

### Easy

You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.

Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.

### Example 1:

Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

### Example 2:

Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 1000
s.length is even.
s consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.

### 解：

计数问题

```go
func halvesAreAlike(s string) bool {
	n := 0
	for i, j := 0, len(s)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
		if isVowel(s[i]) {
			n++
		}
		if isVowel(s[j]) {
			n--
		}
	}
	return n == 0
}

func isVowel(c byte) bool {
	return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u' || c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'I' || c == 'O' || c == 'U'
}
```
